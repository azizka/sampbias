Title: Evaluating Geographic Sampling Bias in Biological Collections
Version: 2.0.0
Authors@R: c(person("Alexander", "Zizka", email = "alexander.zizka@idiv.de",
             role = c("aut", "cre")),
             person("Daniele", "Silvestro", role = "aut"),
             person(given = "Bruno", family = "Vilela", role = "ctb",
             comment = "Bruno updated the code to use new spatial packages"))
Description: Evaluating the biasing impact of geographic features such as airports, cities, roads, rivers in datasets of coordinates based biological collection datasets, by Bayesian estimation of the parameters of a Poisson process. Enables also spatial visualization of sampling bias and includes a set of convenience functions for publication level plotting. Also available as shiny app.
